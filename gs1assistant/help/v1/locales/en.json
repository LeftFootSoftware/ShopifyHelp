    "overview": "## Overview\n\n\n\n**GS1 Assistant** is a powerful Shopify app designed to simplify the process of assigning and managing product identification codes like **GTIN-14, UPC, and EAN** for Shopify merchants.\n\n\n\nThese globally recognized codes are essential for businesses that need to comply with international standards and work with major retailers, marketplaces, and distributors.\n\nThe app integrates directly with **GS1 APIs where available**, allowing merchants to automatically assign unique GTINs to their products, ensuring compliance with retailer requirements and improving product traceability.\n\nWith features like **bulk GTIN assignment**, exportable data in **GS1-approved formats**, and direct API integration with **GS1 Germany** _(with more regions to come)_, GS1 Assistant makes managing product identification **simple, efficient, and scalable**.\n\nWhether you're managing a **small product catalog** or **thousands of variants**, GS1 Assistant gives you full control over your product codes and provides an efficient way to stay compliant with global standards.",
    "mo-capabilities": "## Capabilities by Region\n\n> **Important:** GS1 Assistant works with prefixes from **all** GS1 Member Organizations worldwide. The tables below only indicate where optional **direct synchronization** with a Member Organization's internal repository is available. If a region is listed under *Other Regions*, you can still manage prefixes and GTINs fully in GS1 Assistant; you'll just use **manual import/export** or the MO's portal instead of a direct sync.\n\n> **Optional:** You can choose **not** to use a Member Organization's repository at all. Register GTINs in an MO repository only if:\n>\n> - The MO repository feeds **regional** retailer/marketplace catalogs, or\n> - You need your products listed in **Verified by GS1**.\n\n> **Legend:** \u2705 \u2022 \ud83d\udfe1 \u2022 \u274c \u2022 \u2753 = info pending\n\n> **Membership note:** GS1 global guidance historically suggests \"one MO per company,\" but in practice many MOs accept non-local members.

    "prefix-management": "## Managing Company Prefixes\n\n\n\n**Entering Your Global Company Prefix (GCP)**\n\nWhen adding or managing a company prefix in GS1 Assistant, you'll need to enter your Global Company Prefix (GCP). This is the unique identifier assigned to your company by a GS1 Member Organization.\n\n**Selecting a Prefix**\n\nYou can type your company name in the Company Prefix field to filter the list of available prefixes. This makes it easier to find and select the correct prefix from your account.\n\n**UPC Prefix Conversion**\n\nIf your prefix is a **UPC Prefix** (used for 12-digit barcodes in North America), you must add a leading `0` to convert it into a 13-digit format. This aligns it with GS1's Global Company Prefix (GCP) standard.\n\n**Example:** If your UPC Prefix is `12345`, enter `012345` in the Company Prefix field.\n\n**API Validation Requirements**\n\nIf your prefix is from a region with **Direct API Sync** capabilities (as shown in the \"Capabilities by Region\" table above), validation with API credentials is required.\n\n**For regions with API access:**\n\n1. **Enter your Company Prefix:** Type your company name to filter the list, or type or select your company prefix from the dropdown list.\n\n2. **Verify Prefix Details:** The system will display the prefix details, including:\n   - The prefix number\n   - The GS1 region (e.g., GS1 Germany, GS1 US, GS1 UK)\n   - The company name associated with the prefix\n\n3. **Enter API Credentials:** The specific API credentials required vary by Member Organization. Common requirements include:\n   - API Key\n   - API Secret\n   - Access Token\n   - Other authentication credentials\n\n   Refer to your specific Member Organization's documentation or portal for the exact credentials needed. Some Member Organizations provide links to generate these credentials directly from the prefix management interface.\n\n4. **Save:** Once the API credentials are entered and validated, click the **Save** button to complete the setup.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- API credentials are required to enable direct synchronization between GS1 Assistant and your GS1 Member Organization's repository.\n- Without valid API credentials, you may see a warning that the prefix does not appear to be registered to your business.\n- UPCs and GTINs must come from a prefix licensed to your company in order to be valid for retail and online marketplaces.\n- If you see a warning message, verify that you've entered the correct prefix and that you have the proper API credentials for API-enabled regions.",
    "purchasing-gtins": "## Purchasing GTINs Through the App\n\n\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nIf you need a company prefix to get started, GS1 Assistant can help you choose the right GS1 Member Organization for your business.

    "configuration": "## Configuration\n\n\n\nThe first step in using the GS1 Assistant app is configuring the settings that determine how your GTINs are assigned and managed.\n\nThis section will guide you through manage Company prefix, and configuring the app language.\n\n![screenshot:Get Started](GetStarted.png)\n\n **Manage Company Prefix**\n\n Use your own GS1-assigned global company prefix (GPC) to generate GTINs.\n\nA company prefix is assigned when you purchase barcodes through GS1\n\nThis requires entering your GCP, specifying the GTIN format (UPC/EAN/GTIN-14), and configuring the range of GTINs to be used.\n\n![screenshot:Manage Company Prefix](ManageCompanyPrefix.png)\n\n![screenshot:New Company Prefix](NewCompanyPrefix.png)\n\n **Updating a GS1 Company Prefix**\n\nYou can update an existing company prefix to set specific ranges for GTINs that should be assigned to your products\n\n **1. Open the GS1 Configuration Screen:**\n\n Click the Edit button next to the company prefix you want to update in the list.\n\n **2. Company Prefix and Block Size:**\nThe Company Prefix and Block Size fields are pre-filled and read-only. These fields show the prefix and the size of the block assigned, which cannot be changed after initial configuration.\n\n **3. Sequence Ranges:** You can optionally define sequence ranges for GTIN assignments. These ranges specify the order or sequence in which GTINs will be assigned to product variants from your company prefix block. It’s important to note that the sequence ranges are not the actual GTIN numbers, but the internal sequence positions within the block.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; **Start:** Enter the starting sequence number. This is the first position in the company prefix block from which GTINs will begin to be assigned.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; **End:** Enter the ending sequence number. This is the last sequence position that will be used for GTIN assignments.\n\n![screenshot:Updating Prefix](UpdatingPrefix.png)\n\n **Connecting to GS1**\n\nYou can connect the app to your GS1 account to sync company prefixes and GTIN assignments. Once connected, prefixes stored in your GS1 account will be automatically pulled into the app.\n\n **1.  Connect to GS1:**\n\nClick the Connect to GS1 button to start the process. You will need to generate an API token from your GS1 entity to establish the connection.\n\n**2. Sync Company Prefixes:**\n\nAfter connecting, your company prefixes will be synced with your GS1 account, and the Status column will indicate whether each prefix exists in the GS1 Catalog.\n\n **Note:** The syncing process will not overwrite your local configurations, but will only sync new data from GS1.\n\n![screenshot:PrefixGrid](PrefixGrid.png)\n\n![screenshot:Connect GS1](ConnectGS1.png)\n\n**GS1 Defaults**\n\n This section allows you to set default product information used when assigning GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers). These values help standardize your product listings across GS1-compliant systems and marketplaces.\n\n![screenshot:GS1 Defaults](GS1Defaults.png)",

Bulk GTIN Assignment and Unassignment:**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;You can assign or unassign GTINs for multiple products at once:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Select multiple product variants by checking the boxes next to them\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the **Assign** button at the top of the list to automatically assign available GTINs to all selected variants.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove GTINs, use the **Unassign** button to unassign GTINs from the selected variants.\n\n![screenshot:Bulk GTINS](BulkAction.png)\n\n**Filtering and Searching for Variants**\n\nThe dashboard includes advanced filtering and search options to help you quickly locate specific product variants:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;**Search Bar (Filter Variants):** You can use the search box to enter keywords, product titles, or GTINs to refine the list of variants. This feature allows you to quickly filter products based on their name, description, or other relevant data. For example, entering new in the search bar will filter the list to only show products that contain new in their title ordetails.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;**Status Filters:** Use the status filters (Assigned, Unassigned, Duplicates, Valid, Invalid) to refine the list of products shown on the dashboard.\n\n![screenshot:Filters GTINS](SearchingFilters.png)\n\n**Synchronizing with Your GS1 Catalog**\n\nYou can synchronize your products with your GS1 Catalog in one of two ways:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;**1. Direct Connection:** \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you have configured a direct connection with your GS1 entity (such as GS1 Germany), your products will sync automatically with the GS1 Catalog.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;**2. Exporting and Importing:** \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;  You can also export product data from GS1 Assistant and import it into your GS1 Catalog manually.
